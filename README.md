# Resources for Beginners.

## Introduction

This is for beginners just getting their feet wet in Computer Science

## Terms

We should probably learn some important words first as it makes things faster

### Lingo

| Lingo | Expanded Acronym                 | What it is                                                 |
| ----- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| IDE   | Integrated Developer Environment | A program, that has a user interface, for writing programs |

### Parts of a Computer

| Computer Part | Expanded Acronym                                             | What it does                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CPU           | Central Processing Unit                                      | The hardware that processes and executes your code (This is the very simplified version) |
| RAM/Memory    | Random Access Memory (Computer people will just refer to this as Memory) | The RAM hold memory. Memory holds instructions for your CPU to process and execute |
| HDD/SDD       | HDD (Hard Disk Drive), SSD (Solid State Drive)               | This is the part of the computer that can permanently  hold information. When you execute a saved program, this will load it into memory and then the processor will execute |
| GPU           | Graphics Processing Unit                                     | Specialized processor originally designed to accelerate graphics rendering. Has a wide variety of applications varying from Artificial Intelligence to Gaming because it can do many many things at once. Worthless without a CPU. |
| PSU           | Power Supply Unit                                            | Converts Electricity from AC (Alternating Current) to DC (Direct Current) and then powers all of the other parts |
| MOBO          | Mother Board                                                 | The main circuit board of a computer. This makes it so that the other parts can receive electricity and communicate with each other |



## Suggested Things for Beginners

### Python

I would heavily suggest starting out using python. It is a high-level (meaning easily readable) programming language. Once you learn python, you will be able to learn almost any other programming language. I would use [Conversational Python](https://www.softcover.io/read/e4cd0fd9/conversational-python) to start learning. 

### Thonny

I would heavily suggest using *[Thonny](https://thonny.org/)* for beginners. This is an IDE for first time learners of computer science. This is used to learn Python

### Github

Sign up for a Github account! This allows you to upload your code, and have other people easily look at and interact with your code. 

## Working on Bugs

A bug is anything that is undesirable for a program. This can range from the program not running to the program not running in the desired way. Remember that 10% of programming is actually writing your code. The other 90% is working on bugs. Here are some useful tips:

### Plan your code

Don't code chaotically, or without a direction. Figure out what your goals. There is something called Pseudo Code where you write out your steps and functions. Also use drawings.

 Pseudo code looks something like this:

```
if "1"
	print (I am 1)
if "2"
	print (i am 2)
```

Write the code in the style of the language you are using.

Also, drawings are fantastic to explain and figure out problems. This is why a white board is extremely helpful.

### Continuous Testing

Write some code and then test it. This limits where bugs can occur. Test often!

### Use print statements

When first starting out, use print statements to figure out where your code is failing. This will give you information

### Be Holistic

Look at the code as a system. Break it down into parts and see how the parts of your code interact with each other. 

### One Bug at a time

You might try to fix all of your bugs at one time. Don't do this as you could create more bugs. Fix one bug, then move to the next one. 

### Get ideas

There is a line between looking at someone's code and gathering an idea and straight up copying it. Don't copy. Do get ideas. 

### Check your math

Correct math is VERY important. Ask for math help if you need it. No one will look down on your for this as people have varying understandings of math. Do learn once you get help, and do your research.

### Learn from your mistakes

It is ok to get frustrated or angry. Just go on a walk and grab some coffee. Some of my best ideas have been when I am walking around and after getting frustrated. 

**It is not OK to hang around people and just ask for their code or just have them do it for you.** **It is annoying.** Working through bugs makes you a better person and a smarter programmer.

Once you have figured a bug out, remember what you did to fix that bug. If need be, write it down.
